    <p>Events The events page will be organized in a calendar style something similar to the byui event page but with a different style and organized in a fashion I find more well suited for easy navigation and understanding. The about us page will be a side that will explain why I want to do this idea and will have a way to vote on weather or not they are in support of the idea and weather or not they would go and support a business of this sort.</p>

    <p>The drafted menu that would be included would be more general than specific and throughout the webpage and specific spot there would be a link to send me an email so that they could give me suggestions.</p>
