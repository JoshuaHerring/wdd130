    <p>Interest The website will be mostly informational except for the ability to sign up to perform at more open performances like a comedy night or a talent show. People will want to come to my site to learn this information over others because it is the only site that will have this information. It is a site that is created from scratch for an original idea.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this site would be to gage the interest in the creation of this business and to receive input from others about ideas and things that they would like to see if this were to actually come to pass as a business that would be started here in Rexburg.</p>
