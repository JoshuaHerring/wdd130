        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Home-Page purpose
People will come to my site so that they can learn about my rough business idea that I have. Here they will be able to learn a lot about my business idea. For example, there will be an example homepage for what the actual business would have with an example events page and an about us page as well. It will talk about the ideas for the business from decorations to style to food and beverage services. There will be an example of how they would be able to sign up and petition for the ability to host an event or perform at one of the already existing events and there will also be a live status of how busy the location is. The homepage would include things like photos of the location, any events that are going on for that day, the menu of the location or a rough description of it, and a paragraph persuading people of the location’s excellent ambiance and aura.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        Interest
 The website will be mostly informational except for the ability to sign up to perform at more open performances like a comedy night or a talent show. People will want to come to my site to learn this information over others because it is the only site that will have this information. It is a site that is created from scratch for an original idea. The purpose of this site would be to gage the interest in the creation of this business and to receive input from others about ideas and things that they would like to see if this were to actually come to pass as a business that would be started here in Rexburg.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Events
The events page will be organized in a calendar style something similar to the byui event page but with a different style and organized in a fashion I find more well suited for easy navigation and understanding. The about us page will be a side that will explain why I want to do this idea and will have a way to vote on weather or not they are in support of the idea and weather or not they would go and support a business of this sort. The drafted menu that would be included would be more general than specific and throughout the webpage and specific spot there would be a link to send me an email so that they could give me suggestions.
