    <p>People will come to my site so that they can learn about my rough business idea that I have. Here they will be able to learn a lot about my business idea. For example, there will be an example homepage for what the actual business would have with an example events page and an about us page as well. It will talk about the ideas for the business from decorations to style to food and beverage services. There will be an example of how they would be able to sign up and petition for the ability to host an event or perform at one of the already existing events and there will also be a live status of how busy the location is.</p>
    <img src="./personal_project/images/saloon_out.png" alt="Exterior view of saloon.">
    <p>The homepage would include things like photos of the location, any events that are going on for that day, the menu of the location or a rough description of it, and a paragraph persuading people of the location’s excellent ambiance and aura.</p>
